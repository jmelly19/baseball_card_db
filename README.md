# baseball_card_db
MY MySQL database for my baseball card collection. \

I decided to make this database as practice for myself. I have a large baseball card collection (Over 10,000 cards), and decided that it would be fun to try and enter
all that information into a database, to 1. store my collection, and 2. to practice some of the basic commands needed to create and populate a database.

Update 2/24/2022
Some of the insert statements were messing data and causing information to become unaligned. I'm currently working to find a solution and also make data insertion smoother
and more efficent.
